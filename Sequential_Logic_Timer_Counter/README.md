This work includes a sequential logic circuit that performs timer and counter operations.
generic c_clkfreq: Clock frequency to be used in the design (default 100 MHz). Generic allows you to parameterize the design and change it during compilation/instantiation.
clk: input clock signal (synchronous operation with rising edge).
sw: 2-bit switch/position input; different time limits are selected depending on the position of this switch.
counter: 8-bit output counter

#Architecture head — constants and signals
CONSTANTS
These constants determine the time/cycle count at which the counter will be incremented, relative to the sw position:
"00" → 2 second = c_clkfreq * 2

"01" → 1 second = c_clkfreq

"10" → 500 ms = c_clkfreq / 2

"11" → 250 ms = c_clkfreq / 4
Example: If c_clkfreq = 100_000_000 then c_timer1seclim = 100_000_000 clock cycles correspond to one second.

SIGNALS
timer: Internal counter, incremented at each clock edge; reset when timerlim is reached.

timerlim: Signal that holds the selected time limit (set by combinational assignment depending on the SW).

counter_int: Internal 8-bit counter (to be assigned to the output counter). std_logic_vector is used; however, unsigned is preferred for arithmetic.

#Combinational assignment — timerlim selection

This line maps the timerlim to the sw signal. sw:

"00" → timerlim = 2s

"01" → 1s

"10" → 500ms

other (i.e. "11") → 250ms

This means that when sw changes, the timerlim will take the new value without waiting for a clock edge (combinational).

#Synchronous process — counter logic

With process(clk) and if rising_edge(clk), the process only runs on the positive clock edge—this is synchronous (clocked) logic.

Internal logic:

If the timer value is greater than or equal to timerlim-1, the specified time is complete:

counter_int is incremented by one (the assignment with <= will be held at the clock edge).

The timer is reset (a new cycle count begins).

Otherwise, the timer is incremented by one.

Using timer >= timerlim-1 ensures correct interval management with a 0-based counter (for example, if timerlim = c_clkfreq, the timer counts in the range 0..c_clkfreq-1, and the counter is incremented after the c_clkfreq cycle).

Cautions/Edge cases:

If timerlim is too small or 0, timerlim -1 becomes negative—but since the timer signal is an integer from 0 to c_timer2seclim, negative comparisons can be a potential problem. In reality, the timerlim values ​​here will not be negative in practice, as they come from positive constants. However, for safety, care should be taken to ensure that timerlim is not 0.

The expression counter_int <= counter_int + 1 operates on a std_logic_vector; because STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED is used in this code, the compiler can interpret it and perform the addition. However, the safe and standard notation of unsigned(counter_int) + 1 with numeric_std is preferred.

#Output assignment

counter <= counter_int;

The value of the internal counter_int signal is assigned directly to the external port counter. Because this assignment is concurrent, the output is updated with each change.



#General operational summary — design purpose

This module functions as a timer and event counter.

The counter is incremented by one after the time selected with sw (2 s, 1 s, 500 ms, or 250 ms) has elapsed.

The timer is reset and starts counting again after each specified time interval.

Because the clk frequency is specified with the c_clkfreq generic, it can be used on different platforms (e.g., 50 MHz, 125 MHz).
